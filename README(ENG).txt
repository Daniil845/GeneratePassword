This is my first program, so if you find errors, try to fix them
The essence of the code called "Generate_Passwords" is that the code, depending on how many passwords and characters the user wants, must generate them
The same thing with the code called "Generate_Loggins" is the same as with passwords, only now logins and all characters are used except for certain ones that most services in the authorization system do not accept

"Generate_Passwords_Loggins" is a file in which two codes are combined at once and they work sequentially after each other
